    "    We observe that the vector for a user will have a positive number for actors that tend to appear in movies the user likes and negative numbers for actors user doesn’t like, Consider a movie with actors which user likes and only a few actors which user doesn’t like, then the cosine angle between the user’s and movie’s vectors will be a large positive fraction. Thus, the angle will be close to 0, therefore a small cosine distance between the vectors.\n",
    "    It represents that the user tends to like the movie, if the cosine distance is large, then we tend to avoid the item from the recommendation.\n",
