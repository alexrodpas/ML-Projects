# ML-Projects
Machine Learning projects for my own learning and training (pun intended).

A collection of Python files and scripts, and Jupyter notebooks across Classification, Regression, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and more.

1. [TEDx talk (content-based) recommender system](https://github.com/alexrodpas/ML-Projects/blob/main/TED-Talks-RecSys.ipynb): In this notebook, we build a very basic content-based Machine Learning recommender system that can recommend TED talks based on the topics of your interest.
2. [COVID 19 Detection from chest X-Rays using a CNN Classifier](https://github.com/alexrodpas/ML-Projects/blob/main/COVID19-Dtct-XRay.ipynb): In this notebook, we will use X-ray data of lungs from normal, COVID-positive and viral-pneumonia patients, and train a deep learning model with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to differentiate between them.
