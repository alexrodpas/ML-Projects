    "# Abstractive summarization with T5 Transformer model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "__Automatic summarization__ is one of the central problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Summarization consists on creating a shorter version of a document or an article that captures all the important information. It poses several challenges relating to language understanding (e.g. identifying important content) and generation (e.g. aggregating and rewording the identified content into a summary).\n",
    "Along with translation, it is another example of a task that can be formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Summarization can be: \n",
    "\n",
    "- _Extractive_: extract the most relevant information from a document.\n",
    "- _Abstractive_: generate new text that captures the most relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will approach the problem of single-document abstractive summarization. Following prior work, we aim to tackle this problem using a sequence-to-sequence model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The T5 model\n",
    "\n",
    "[Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) is a [Transformer-based](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model built on the encoder-decoder architecture, pretrained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks where each task is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 shows impressive results in a variety of sequence-to-sequence tasks like summarization, translation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T5 model was presented in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683) by Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer, Adam Roberts, Katherine Lee, Sharan Narang, Michael Matena, Yanqi Zhou, Wei Li, Peter J. Liu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T5 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which each task is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 works well on a variety of tasks out-of-the-box by prepending a different prefix to the input corresponding to each task, e.g., for translation: translate English to German: …, for summarization: summarize: ….\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The pretraining includes both supervised and self-supervised training. Supervised training is conducted on downstream tasks provided by the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks (converting them into text-to-text tasks as explained above).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Self-supervised training uses corrupted tokens, by randomly removing 15% of the tokens and replacing them with individual sentinel tokens (if several consecutive tokens are marked for removal, the whole group is replaced with a single sentinel token). The input of the encoder is the corrupted sentence, the input of the decoder is the original sentence and the target is then the dropped out tokens delimited by their sentinel tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T5 uses relative scalar embeddings. Encoder input padding can be done on the left and on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative models that can be used in this notebook instead of T5 include:\n",
